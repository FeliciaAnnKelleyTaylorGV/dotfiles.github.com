# GitHub ‚ù§ `~/`

Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

* **_Backup_**, **_restore_**, and **_sync_** the prefs and settings for your
toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
* **_Learn_** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new
tricks for the ones you already use.
* **_Share_** what you've learned with the rest of us.

## Navigating this site

If you're just starting out, before you go symlinking everything in `~/*`, you
might want to check out some [tutorials](/tutorials/) that discuss how you can
organize your dotfiles. Next, you could look through the [general-purpose
dotfiles utilities](/utilities/) to find a system you can use to manage your
dotfiles. Some [tool-specific frameworks](/frameworks/) could save you time in
customizing specific programs like your shell.

Prefer to start from a popular base configuration? Check out dotfiles
[bootstrap repositories](/bootstrap/). Or just looking for inspiration, to see
how others are doing things? Check out other GitHub users'
[dotfiles](/inspiration/) or Reddit's [r/dotfiles](https://reddit.com/r/dotfiles)
subreddit.
