# FAQ

## Why create this site?

Some of your [fellow GitHub friends](https://github.com/dotfiles) have
found incredible value in digging through Other People's Dotfiles
(OPD). We aim to share that knowledge with you, our fellow wayfaring
stranger in the shell.

## You totally need to know about a great bootstrap or framework, how do I submit?

Great! We're always looking for new projects to follow. Please submit a PR or an Issue.

## Oh no! I've committed passwords/API keys/other sensitive data!

We've got you covered! Take a look at the [sensitive data removal
guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).

## Your FAQ is weak. It *so* did not answer my question.

That's not a question. But feel free to [ask us anything on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/octodots), or to create an issue on this repository. Maybe we can expand this list.
